## WRDS database set-up
**Great resources to get started/ refer**:
- [Retrieving historical members S&P500](https://library.smu.edu.sg/topics-insights/notes-and-thoughts-retrieving-historical-members-sp-500-wrds)
- 
**Steps**
- Create a .pgpass file to store username and password
- pip install wrds
- Establish connection via `wrds.Connection()`
- The easiest way to look at the data is to go to WRDS SAS Studio.
- Get the variable schema of any table on SAS studio: 
```sql 
proc contents data= crsp.dsf;
run
```
## Database Schema

- Sentiment file: Provide link here 
**Notes:**
- As of July 202, Compustat no longer has S&P Dow Jones Indices. Access it through CRSP.
- For data after February 2025, you will need to change the data tables to their "*_V2" counterpart.
