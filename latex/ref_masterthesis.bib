  abstract = {Rules embody a set of if-then statements which include one or more conditions to classify a subset of samples in a dataset. In various applications such classification rules are considered to be interpretable by the decision makers. We introduce two new algorithms for interpretability and learning. Both algorithms take advantage of linear programming, and hence, they are scalable to large data sets. The first algorithm extracts rules for interpretation of trained models that are based on tree/rule ensembles. The second algorithm generates a set of classification rules through a column generation approach. The proposed algorithms return a set of rules along with their optimal weights indicating the importance of each rule for classification. Moreover, our algorithms allow assigning cost coefficients, which could relate to different attributes of the rules, such as; rule lengths, estimator weights, number of false negatives, and so on. Thus, the decision makers can adjust these coefficients to divert the training process and obtain a set of rules that are more appealing for their needs. We have tested the performances of both algorithms on a collection of datasets and presented a case study to elaborate on optimal rule weights. Our results show that a good compromise between interpretability and accuracy can be obtained by the proposed algorithms.},

Hendricks, Patel and Zeckhauser's (1993) "hot hands" result is mostly driven by the one-year momentum effect of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), but individual funds do not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy in stocks. The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong underperformanceby the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I examine the five-factor model in 23 developed stock markets. Using the firm level data from July 1992 to December 2014, I form the 25 size-book to market, the 25 size-gross profitability (GP), and the 25 size-investment (Inv) portfolios. I use three factor, four factor and five factor models to explain the returns on these portfolios using regional as well as global factors. I find that the results for the five-factor model in North America, Europe, and Global markets are similar to the results for the U.S. stock market. But the results for gross profitability (GP) and investment (Inv.) suggest that these two new factors either do not add any explanatory power or are much weaker in Japan and Asia Pacific portfolios. The results also suggest that regional models perform much better than global models. This may imply that markets are still not fully integrated. With inclusion of the two new factors, the value factor still remains significant in all regions in contrast to the US market results.},

The five-factor model's main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model's performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.},

Profitable firms generate significantly higher returns than unprofitable firms, despite having significantly higher valuation ratios. Controlling for profitability also dramatically increases the performance of value strategies, especially among the largest, most liquid stocks. These results are difficult to reconcile with popular explanations of the value premium, as profitable firms are less prone to distress, have longer cash flow durations, and have lower levels of operating leverage. Controlling for gross profitability explains most earnings related anomalies and a wide range of seemingly unrelated profitable trading strategies.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the risk adjusted performance of US sector/industry portfolios in terms of Fama-French five factor model. We find that five factor model fits better the returns of US sector portfolios, but that significant alphas are still present in all the sectors at some point in time. In the overall period, 50\% of sectors generate significant five factor alpha. We argue that, if such alpha signifies a true sector out/underperformance, one can devise a sector rotation strategy to achieve abnormal performance over time. Our long-only sector rotation strategy that buys a sector with a rolling positive alpha generates four times higher Sharpe ratio than the S\&P500 buy-and-hold. If the strategy is adjusted to switch to a risk free rate in recessions, the Sharpe ratio achieved is ten-fold the buy-and-hold.},

  abstract = {Despite producing mixed findings, the Fama and French's (2015) model has been widely used to explain stock returns. This paper conducts a systematic literature review of the Fama and French's (2015) five factor model to evaluate its empirical validity in estimating the average returns of stocks. The review revolves around four major themes: performance of the fivefactor model in explaining stock returns and whether it outperforms the three-factor model in stock returns estimation; predictive power of the two new factors in the five-factor model namely profitability and investment factors; value factor's redundancy for describing average stock returns after accounting for profitability and investment factors; and the exploration of other factors that could enhance the model's explanatory power. The paper used the PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method as a search strategy to conduct the systematic reviews. Highly cited articles published the Web of Science database from 2015 to 2022 were explored and a final sample of 61 were used in the review. The reviews find that in most studies, the Fama-French five-factor model is superior to the three-factor model in predicting the average stock market return at the national and regional levels. On the predictive power of profitability and investment factors, the findings were mixed. Similar conclusion was reached for the redundancy of value factor in explaining stock returns. Several other factors have also been found to increase the explanatory power of the five-factor model. The systematic literature of this paper evaluates several specific research questions related to Fama-French models, thereby providing researchers an understanding of the research topic and its evolution over time. Future review could be further expanded further to include articles from the Scopus-indexed journals. Insights from this paper are also useful for investors engaging in factor investing and in formulating asset allocation strategy.},

The negative abnormal capital investment/return relation is shown to be stronger for firms that have greater investment discretion, i.e., firms with higher cash flows and lower debt ratios, and is shown to be significant only in time periods when hostile takeovers were less prevalent. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that investors tend to underreact to the empire building implications of increased investment expenditures. Although firms that increase capital investments tend to have high past returns and often issue equity, the negative abnormal capital investment/return relation is independent of the previously documented long-term return reversal and secondary equity issue anomalies.},
