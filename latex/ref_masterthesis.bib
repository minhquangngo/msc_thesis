  abstract = {This paper solves explicitly a simple equilibrium model with liquidity risk. In our liquidityadjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition, a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect asset prices. Our empirical results shed light on the total and relative economic significance of these channels and provide evidence of flight to liquidity.},

  abstract = {Rules embody a set of if-then statements which include one or more conditions to classify a subset of samples in a dataset. In various applications such classification rules are considered to be interpretable by the decision makers. We introduce two new algorithms for interpretability and learning. Both algorithms take advantage of linear programming, and hence, they are scalable to large data sets. The first algorithm extracts rules for interpretation of trained models that are based on tree/rule ensembles. The second algorithm generates a set of classification rules through a column generation approach. The proposed algorithms return a set of rules along with their optimal weights indicating the importance of each rule for classification. Moreover, our algorithms allow assigning cost coefficients, which could relate to different attributes of the rules, such as; rule lengths, estimator weights, number of false negatives, and so on. Thus, the decision makers can adjust these coefficients to divert the training process and obtain a set of rules that are more appealing for their needs. We have tested the performances of both algorithms on a collection of datasets and presented a case study to elaborate on optimal rule weights. Our results show that a good compromise between interpretability and accuracy can be obtained by the proposed algorithms.},

The illiquidity measure here is the average across stocks of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets. Illiquidity affects more strongly small firm stocks, thus explaining time series variations in their premiums over time. r 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Fama---MacBeth-type regressions using risk adjusted returns provide evidence of return momentum, size, and book-to-market effects, together with a significant and negative relation between returns and trading volume, even after accounting for the CK factors. When the analysis is repeated using the FF factors, we find that the size and book-to-market effects are attenuated, while the momentum and trading volume effects persist.

Thus, we propose a framework for discussing both the black box problem and the explainability of AI. We argue further that contrary to often defended claims the opacity issue is not a genuine problem. We also dismiss the justification problem.

I find that the results for the five-factor model in North America, Europe, and Global markets are similar to the results for the U.S. stock market. But the results for gross profitability (GP) and investment (Inv.) suggest that these two new factors either do not add any explanatory power or are much weaker in Japan and Asia Pacific portfolios. The results also suggest that regional models perform much better than global models. This may imply that markets are still not fully integrated. With inclusion of the two new factors, the value factor still remains significant in all regions in contrast to the US market results.},

The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work.

Our long-only sector rotation strategy that buys a sector with a rolling positive alpha generates four times higher Sharpe ratio than the S\&P500 buy-and-hold.

  abstract = {The presence of investor sentiment pushes asset prices away from the equilibrium level justified by underlying fundamentals. While sentiment is not directly observable, identifying appropriate proxies and, quantifying the impact of sentiment on asset prices is an important topic. Asset prices that do not appropriately reflect fundamental values may result in inefficient allocation of capital -- impacting portfolio allocation decisions and the cost of capital. Utilizing a number of sentiment proxies, over the period 1990--2015, we demonstrate a strong relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns that is consistent with theoretical explanations of sentiment. We determine that implied volatility index (VIX) is the preferred measure of sentiment in terms of improving model fit and adding explanatory power. Causality tests suggest that investor fear (VIX) drives returns across firm-size and value, and also across industry. We also illustrate that firms that are more subjective to value, or face limits to arbitrage, such as small-cap stocks, or those in the business equipment (technology) or telecoms industry, are most responsive to changes investor sentiment. Finally, we demonstrate that sentiment has a greater influence on market returns during recession, when sentiment is at its lowest ebb, and this is particularly true for those stocks most susceptible to speculative demand.},

  abstract = {Despite producing mixed findings, the Fama and French's (2015) model has been widely used to explain stock returns. This paper conducts a systematic literature review of the Fama and French's (2015) five factor model to evaluate its empirical validity in estimating the average returns of stocks. The review revolves around four major themes: performance of the fivefactor model in explaining stock returns and whether it outperforms the three-factor model in stock returns estimation; predictive power of the two new factors in the five-factor model namely profitability and investment factors; value factor's redundancy for describing average stock returns after accounting for profitability and investment factors; and the exploration of other factors that could enhance the model's explanatory power. The paper used the PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method as a search strategy to conduct the systematic reviews. Highly cited articles published the Web of Science database from 2015 to 2022 were explored and a final sample of 61 were used in the review. The reviews find that in most studies, the Fama-French five-factor model is superior to the three-factor model in predicting the average stock market return at the national and regional levels. On the predictive power of profitability and investment factors, the findings were mixed. Similar conclusion was reached for the redundancy of value factor in explaining stock returns. Several other factors have also been found to increase the explanatory power of the five-factor model. The systematic literature of this paper evaluates several specific research questions related to Fama-French models, thereby providing researchers an understanding of the research topic and its evolution over time. Future review could be further expanded further to include articles from the Scopus-indexed journals. Insights from this paper are also useful for investors engaging in factor investing and in formulating asset allocation strategy.},

  abstract = {Firms that substantially increase capital investments subsequently achieve negative benchmark-adjusted returns. The negative abnormal capital investment/return relation is shown to be stronger for firms that have greater investment discretion, i.e., firms with higher cash flows and lower debt ratios, and is shown to be significant only in time periods when hostile takeovers were less prevalent. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that investors tend to underreact to the empire building implications of increased investment expenditures. Although firms that increase capital investments tend to have high past returns and often issue equity, the negative abnormal capital investment/return relation is independent of the previously documented long-term return reversal and secondary equity issue anomalies.},

  abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that the equilibrium stock price is not affected by investor sentiment, and the equilibrium price at an early time is higher than the one at a later time. In contrast to this wisdom, we present a dynamic asset pricing model with investor sentiment and we find that investor sentiment has a significant impact on the equilibrium stock price. The equilibrium stock price, which is affected by pessimistic sentiment at time 0, may be lower than the one at time 1. Moreover, consistent with the reality stock market, our model shows that time varying sentiments can lead to various price changes. Finally, the model could offer a partial explanation for the financial anomaly of high volatility.},
