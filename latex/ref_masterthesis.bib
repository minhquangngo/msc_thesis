  abstract = {This paper solves explicitly a simple equilibrium model with liquidity risk. In our liquidityadjusted capital asset pricing model, a security's required return depends on its expected liquidity as well as on the covariances of its own return and liquidity with the market return and liquidity. In addition, a persistent negative shock to a security's liquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The model provides a unified framework for understanding the various channels through which liquidity risk may affect asset prices. Our empirical results shed light on the total and relative economic significance of these channels and provide evidence of flight to liquidity.},

The illiquidity measure here is the average across stocks of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets. Illiquidity affects more strongly small firm stocks, thus explaining time series variations in their premiums over time. r 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The security market line accords with the capital asset pricing model by taking on an upward slope in pessimistic sentiment periods, but is downward sloping during optimistic periods. We hypothesize that this finding obtains because periods of optimism attract equity investment by unsophisticated, overconfident, traders in risky opportunities (high beta stocks), whereas such traders stay along the sidelines during pessimistic periods. Thus, high beta stocks become overpriced in optimistic periods, but during pessimistic periods, noise trading is reduced, so that traditional beta pricing prevails. Unconditional on sentiment, these effects offset each other. Although rational explanations cannot completely be ruled out, analyses using earnings expectations, fund flows, the probability of informed trading, and order imbalances do provide evidence that noise traders are more bullish about high beta stocks when sentiment is optimistic, whereas investor behavior appears to accord more closely with rationality during pessimistic periods, supporting our hypothesis.

State-of-the-art learning algorithms are often referred to as ``black boxes'' because of the high number of operations involved in their prediction process. Despite their powerful predictivity, this lack of interpretability may be highly restrictive for applications with critical decisions at stake. On the other hand, algorithms with a simple structure---typically decision trees, rule algorithms, or sparse linear models---are well known for their instability. This undesirable feature makes the conclusions of the data analysis unreliable and turns out to be a strong operational limitation. This motivates the design of SIRUS, based on random forests, which combines a simple structure, a remarkable stable behavior when data is perturbed, and an accuracy comparable to its competitors. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method both empirically (through experiments) and theoretically (with the proof of its asymptotic stability). A R/C++ software implementation sirus is available from CRAN.},

Fama---MacBeth-type regressions using risk adjusted returns provide evidence of return momentum, size, and book-to-market effects, together with a significant and negative relation between returns and trading volume, even after accounting for the CK factors. When the analysis is repeated using the FF factors, we find that the size and book-to-market effects are attenuated, while the momentum and trading volume effects persist.

Thus, we propose a framework for discussing both the black box problem and the explainability of AI. We argue further that contrary to often defended claims the opacity issue is not a genuine problem. We also dismiss the justification problem. Further, we describe the tensions involved in the strangeness and unpredictability problems and suggest some ways to alleviate them.},

I use three factor, four factor and five factor models to explain the returns on these portfolios using regional as well as global factors. I find that the results for the five-factor model in North America, Europe, and Global markets are similar to the results for the U.S. stock market. But the results for gross profitability (GP) and investment (Inv.) suggest that these two new factors either do not add any explanatory power or are much weaker in Japan and Asia Pacific portfolios. The results also suggest that regional models perform much better than global models. This may imply that markets are still not fully integrated. With inclusion of the two new factors, the value factor still remains significant in all regions in contrast to the US market results.},

We find that such predictability is diminished when bid-ask spreads are narrower, and has declined over time with the minimum tick size.

These findings indicate that liquidity stimulates arbitrage activity, which, in turn, enhances market efficiency. Further, as the tick size decreased, open-close/close-open return variance ratios increased, while return autocorrelations decreased. This suggests an increased incorporation of private information into prices during more liquid regimes.},

The evidence suggests that only in the expansion state does sentiment perform both in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power for the returns of portfolio formed on size, book-tomarket equity ratio, dividend yield, earnings-to-price ratio, age, return volatility, asset tangibility, growth opportunities, and 11 widely documented anomalies.

Specifically, we call attention to the fact that, in both models, the investment factor is based on the measure of growth in total assets from Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008) and not on what most researchers would view as traditional measures of corporate investment. For both models, we show that there are large decreases in their ability to price the cross-section of returns when the investment factor is instead constructed using the traditional investment measures, or when it is constructed using arguably more complete measures that account for investment in intangibles. Additionally, we do not find a significant decrease in performance when we replace the asset-growth factor with a factor based on growth in noncash current assets or long-term debt (which cannot be complete measures of investment). Our results challenge the idea that traditional investment models can fully account for the explanatory power of the asset-growth factor used in the Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015) and Fama and French (2015) models.},

We show that the MAX effect is strongly dependent on investor sentiment and is mainly due to the poor performance of high MAX stocks rather than high returns of low MAX stocks. Investors' desire to gamble in high MAX stocks is not limited to individual investors but is also present amongst some institutions. Controlling for past sentiment reduces the significance of the MAX effect.

Each rule consists of a conjunction of a small number of simple statements concerning the values of individual input variables. These rule ensembles are shown to produce predictive accuracy comparable to the best methods. However, their principal advantage lies in interpretation. Because of its simple form, each rule is easy to understand, as is its influence on individual predictions, selected subsets of predictions, or globally over the entire space of joint input variable values. Similarly, the degree of relevance of the respective input variables can be assessed globally, locally in different regions of the input space, or at individual prediction points. Techniques are presented for automatically identifying those variables that are involved in interactions with other variables, the strength and degree of those interactions, as well as the identities of the other variables with which they interact. Graphical representations are used to visualize both main and interaction effects.},

The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},

The random walk hypothesis and efficient market hypothesis essentially state that it is not possible to systematically, reliably predict future stock prices or forecast changes in the stock market overall. Nonetheless, machine learning (ML) techniques that use historical data have been applied to make such predictions. Previous studies focused on a small number of stocks and claimed success with limited statistical confidence. In this study, we construct feature vectors composed of multiple previous relative returns and apply the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM) ML methods as classifiers to predict whether a stock can return 2\% more than its index in the following 10 days. We apply this approach to all S\&P 500 companies for the period 2017--2022. We assess performance using accuracy, precision, and recall and compare our results with a random choice strategy. We observe that the LSTM classifier outperforms RF and SVM, and the data-driven ML methods outperform the random choice classifier (p = 8.46e-17 for accuracy of LSTM). Thus, we demonstrate that the probability that the random walk and efficient market hypotheses hold in the considered context is negligibly small.},

To illustrate the practical relevance of our network pricing approach,we apply it to the pricing and delta-hedging of S\&P 500 futures options from 1987 to 1991.},

The multi-factor method is instrumental in establishing the linear relationship between return and risk in diversified portfolios, despite its notable flaws, which are more evident in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, machine learning algorithms have emerged as a valuable means to compensate for theoretical model shortcomings. This research examines the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and LSTM-RNN machine learning techniques for assessing the Fama-French five-factor model (Long ShortTerm Memory Recurrent Neural Network). Hypothetical data for the Ho Chi Minh City market from January 2015 through June 2023 form the basis of this study. The FF5 model based on the LSTM-RNN algorithm outperforms the OLS model when comparing prediction error using the rolling window method and calculating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This underscores the importance of investors and fund managers adopting LSTMRNN to improve forecasting efficiency in portfolio management.},

We find that five factor model fits better the returns of US sector portfolios, but that significant alphas are still present in all the sectors at some point in time. In the overall period, 50\% of sectors generate significant five factor alpha. We argue that, if such alpha signifies a true sector out/underperformance, one can devise a sector rotation strategy to achieve abnormal performance over time. Our long-only sector rotation strategy that buys a sector with a rolling positive alpha generates four times higher Sharpe ratio than the S\&P500 buy-and-hold. If the strategy is adjusted to switch to a risk free rate in recessions, the Sharpe ratio achieved is ten-fold the buy-and-hold.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the risk-adjusted performance of US sector portfolios and sector rotation strategy using the alphas from the Fama-French five factor model. We find that fivefactor model fits better the returns of US sector portfolios than the three factor model, but that significant alphas are still present in all the sectors at some point in time. In the full sample period, 50\% of sectors generate significant five-factor alpha. We test if such alpha signifies a true sector out/underperformance by applying simple long-only and long-short sector rotation strategies. Our long-only sector rotation strategy that buys a sector with a positive five-factor alpha generates four times higher Sharpe ratio than the S\&P500 buy-and-hold. If the strategy is adjusted to switch to the risk-free asset in recessions, the Sharpe ratio achieved is ten-fold that of the buy-and-hold. The long-short strategy fares less well.},

We compare the predictive accuracy of a large set of sentiment analysis models using a sample of articles that have been rated by humans on a positivity/negativity scale. The results highlight the gains from combining existing lexicons and from accounting for negation. We also generate our own sentiment-scoring model, which includes a new lexicon built specifically to capture the sentiment in economic news articles. This model is shown to have better predictive accuracy than existing, ``off-the-shelf'', models. Lastly, we provide two applications to the economic research on sentiment. First, we show that daily news sentiment is predictive of movements of survey-based measures of consumer sentiment. Second, motivated by Barsky and Sims (2012), we estimate the impulse responses of macroeconomic variables to sentiment shocks, finding that positive sentiment shocks increase consumption, output, and interest rates and dampen inflation.},

  abstract = {The presence of investor sentiment pushes asset prices away from the equilibrium level justified by underlying fundamentals. While sentiment is not directly observable, identifying appropriate proxies and, quantifying the impact of sentiment on asset prices is an important topic. Asset prices that do not appropriately reflect fundamental values may result in inefficient allocation of capital -- impacting portfolio allocation decisions and the cost of capital. Utilizing a number of sentiment proxies, over the period 1990--2015, we demonstrate a strong relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns that is consistent with theoretical explanations of sentiment. We determine that implied volatility index (VIX) is the preferred measure of sentiment in terms of improving model fit and adding explanatory power. Causality tests suggest that investor fear (VIX) drives returns across firm-size and value, and also across industry. We also illustrate that firms that are more subjective to value, or face limits to arbitrage, such as small-cap stocks, or those in the business equipment (technology) or telecoms industry, are most responsive to changes investor sentiment. Finally, we demonstrate that sentiment has a greater influence on market returns during recession, when sentiment is at its lowest ebb, and this is particularly true for those stocks most susceptible to speculative demand.},

  abstract = {Despite producing mixed findings, the Fama and French's (2015) model has been widely used to explain stock returns. This paper conducts a systematic literature review of the Fama and French's (2015) five factor model to evaluate its empirical validity in estimating the average returns of stocks. The review revolves around four major themes: performance of the fivefactor model in explaining stock returns and whether it outperforms the three-factor model in stock returns estimation; predictive power of the two new factors in the five-factor model namely profitability and investment factors; value factor's redundancy for describing average stock returns after accounting for profitability and investment factors; and the exploration of other factors that could enhance the model's explanatory power. The paper used the PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method as a search strategy to conduct the systematic reviews. Highly cited articles published the Web of Science database from 2015 to 2022 were explored and a final sample of 61 were used in the review. The reviews find that in most studies, the Fama-French five-factor model is superior to the three-factor model in predicting the average stock market return at the national and regional levels. On the predictive power of profitability and investment factors, the findings were mixed. Similar conclusion was reached for the redundancy of value factor in explaining stock returns. Several other factors have also been found to increase the explanatory power of the five-factor model. The systematic literature of this paper evaluates several specific research questions related to Fama-French models, thereby providing researchers an understanding of the research topic and its evolution over time. Future review could be further expanded further to include articles from the Scopus-indexed journals. Insights from this paper are also useful for investors engaging in factor investing and in formulating asset allocation strategy.},

Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The IVOL-return relation is negative among overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative relation among overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive relation among underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative relation among overpriced stocks.},

These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that investors tend to underreact to the empire building implications of increased investment expenditures. Although firms that increase capital investments tend to have high past returns and often issue equity, the negative abnormal capital investment/return relation is independent of the previously documented long-term return reversal and secondary equity issue anomalies.},

The low forecasting power of that index for future aggregate stock market returns has long been a puzzle, and we demonstrate that its ability to empirically capture latent investor sentiment can be significantly improved by allowing contributions of its individual components to vary over time, rather than being fixed. Our enhanced index represents an improved measure of investor sentiment: empirically, we find that our sentiment index not only instils forecasting power to the original Baker and Wurgler (2006) index, it also outperforms competitor measures in empirically capturing unobservable sentiment. This superior empirical performance is demonstrated to be due to investors' irrational expectations about future discount rates. Lastly, sentiment measured by our enhanced index contains useful and unique information about future market returns, as it outperforms fundamental economic predictors in forecasting, in both the statistical and economic sense.},
