The period of this research will be from 1990 until 2018, due to data availability and quality. Data for the most recent years are not included due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in which liquidity, sentiment and the economy of the entire world was affected. The main datasets in this thesis will be gathered from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS)\footnote{https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu} via Python API queries with the \texttt{wrds}, which contains all of the data points relating to liquidity risk,FF5/C4F factors and excess returns. The \texttt{permno}, or stocks the stocks' permanent identifier is specifically queried from the \texttt{crsp\_a\_indexes.dsp500list\_v2}
file. All of the other data points relating to liquidity risk, Fama-French factors and excess returns are either queried or calculated using the data points from the \texttt{crps.dsf} database. The sector classification is specifically derived from the \texttt{comp.company} file. With the same \texttt{gvkey, permno} keys, the datasets queried could be joined.

The enhanced sentiment index from the \citeA{ung_2023} is available directly from the paper's journal homepage, under "Supplemental Material" \footnote{https://doi.org/10.1080/1351847X.2023.2247440.}.
