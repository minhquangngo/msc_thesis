Asset pricing models have historically been pivotal for understanding expected returns and constructing investment strategies. Despite the evolution from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) of \citeA{sharpe_1964} to the advanced Fama-French Five Factor (FF5) model by \citeA{ff5_2015}, empirical research continues to highlight persistent gaps and unexplained anomalies in asset pricing. Recent literature suggests that integrating additional factors, such as liquidity risk and investor sentiment, could improve the predictive capabilities of these models. Additionally, machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest (RF), have emerged as promising tools for capturing complex, nonlinear relationships among asset pricing factors. This thesis aims to investigate the following research question: 
\begin{center}
    \textit{Does the incorporation of liquidity risk and sentiment into asset pricing models via Random Forest and rule-based regression yield a higher performing sector rotation strategy?}
\end{center}

This research is particularly relevant for portfolio managers, financial analysts, and institutional investors seeking improved asset allocation strategies and enhanced returns through sector rotation. Traditional asset pricing models, such as CAPM, FF3, C4F, and FF5, consistently demonstrate limitations in capturing complex, nonlinear market dynamics, particularly concerning liquidity risk and investor sentiment. By integrating liquidity risk and investor sentiment into these established models via advanced machine learning techniques like Random Forest, the research offers practical insights that could enhance predictive accuracy and investment decision-making. Additionally, this thesis is relevant for scholars interested in extending asset pricing literature through innovative machine learning applications, addressing longstanding theoretical and empirical limitations associated with linear factor models and identifying effective mechanisms for systematically extracting actionable trading strategies.
