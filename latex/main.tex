	In addition to the timeline provided, I intend to frequently send my current work to Professor Akyuz for feedback. Meaning, for each of the steps listed in the timeline, the latest update to the first draft of the thesis will be sent to Professor Akyuz. While waiting for his feedback on a particular section, I will continue to work on the next section.
