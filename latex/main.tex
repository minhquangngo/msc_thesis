\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Hakan Akyuz, for his invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout the course of this thesis. I am also grateful to my second assessor, Martijn de Jong, and the faculty at Erasmus School of Economics for their constructive feedback and academic inspiration. Most importantly, I owe everything to my family. Their constant encouragement and firm belief in me have kept me going through all the tough times and doubts. Their support has always been my anchor, constantly inspiring me and reminding me of the joy and love that motivate my studies. Thank you all for your indispensable contributions to my Masters' thesis.

\begin{abstract}
This thesis investigates whether augmenting classical multi-factor asset-pricing frameworks with liquidity risk and investor sentiment factors can improve return forecasts and yield an actionable, transparent sector-rotation strategy. Daily data for all S\&P500 constituents from 1998-2018 are combined with a set of liquidity proxies and three sentiment indices. Four model families are estimated: the Carhart four-factor and Fama-French five-factor benchmarks and their enhanced counterparts that embed liquidity risk and sentiment measures. The paper uses the traditional asset pricing framework of ordinary least squares and Random Forest estimators in an expanding window design with rigorous out-of-sample validation. Random Forest boosts explanatory power, raising average in-sample $R^{2}$ from $<1\%$ under OLS to about $60\%$ and cutting hold-out mean squared error by up to two orders of magnitude. Diebold-Mariano tests confirm that forecast accuracy improves significantly ($p<0.01$) when moving from ordinary least squares to Random Forest, and improves again when augmenting Random Forest with the enhanced feature set for select sectors. Due to Random Forest's black-box nature, interpretability must be restored through pseudo-betas: elasticity estimates weighted by relative feature importance. This substitution for OLS betas in RF reveals that the Amihud Illiquidity measure and news sentiment dominate. Feeding all of the created models into Association Rule Learning yields if-then signals that aid daily sector-rotation strategies. In the 2018 hold-out year, the unconstrained strategy from the Carhart four-factor model enhanced with liquidity and sentiment earns a cumulative return of 5.2\% and an active return of 12.3\%, while the S\&P500 loses 7.03\%. A turnover-capped variant still outperforms both the index and a naÃ¯ve equal-weight benchmark after trading costs. However, the sector-rotation profits are not statistically significant, as we cannot demonstrate that the strategy's Sharpe ratio is statistically greater than zero. The findings demonstrate that machine-learning asset pricing models can combine predictive accuracy with financial interpretability, enrich the Fama-French framework with economically motivated factors, and translate statistical gains into a transparent tool of direct relevance to asset managers, risk officers, and marketing strategists. However, statistical tests of the strategy's Sharpe ratio fail to reject the null hypothesis of zero, indicating that its performance relative to the S\&P500 cannot be demonstrated with statistical significance.
