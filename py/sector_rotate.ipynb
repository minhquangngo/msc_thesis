    "In Simonian et al. (2019) the Fama–French–Carhart (FFC) factor **realisations for the current month *t*** are fed straight into a Random-Forest model as predictor variables (“features”) to generate a point estimate of each sector’s excess return⁠—what the paper calls the “RF-predicted return”﻿.\n",
    "\n",
    "That RF-predicted return is then used **as a trading signal for the *next* month ( *t + 1*)** inside the association-rule-learning (ARL) overlay that powers the sector-rotation strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “the signals are the RF-predicted return of a sector … and the ratio of volatilities … If … the RF-predicted return for **next month** is greater than a designated threshold value, then we will own the sector for the month”﻿.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Month *t***\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Observe the four FFC factor returns (MKT, SMB, HML, MOM).\n",
    "   * Feed them into the trained RF to obtain a *contemporaneous* predicted sector return.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Month *t + 1***\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Treat that predicted value (together with a volatility-ratio signal) as an input to ARL rules that decide whether the sector is held during month *t + 1*.\n",
    "   * Evaluate the realised return over month *t + 1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the model **does not** do\n",
    "\n",
    "* It never forecasts the factor returns themselves for *t + 1*; it simply uses the observed factor values at *t*.\n",
    "* The risk-decomposition (pseudo-beta) exercise appears later in the article and is presented only as an interpretability device—translating RF feature importances into something that looks like traditional betas﻿. Those pseudo-betas are **not** fed back into the predictive model or the trading rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom line:** the author uses the month-*t* Fama–French factor returns directly to produce a model-based prediction of sector returns, and that prediction becomes one of the signals for trading one month ahead; factor-risk decompositions are used solely for ex-post interpretation, not for forecasting.\n"
